    <h1 class="post-title">Garden of Go</h1>

    <p>This is my curated list of Go links to talks, tutorials, articles, and other
things that have impacted my learning of this wonderful language.
While this is a post, expect it to be maintained regularly.
If you want to suggest a link, please <a href="https://github.com/jdholdren/blog/issues/new">open an issue</a>.</p>
<h1>Getting started</h1>
<p>New to Go? Start here.</p>
<h2><a href="https://go.dev">go.dev</a></h2>
<p>This is the official site for Go and the Go blog.
You can download Go here, as well as take a <a href="https://go.dev/tour/welcome/1">tour</a> of the language.</p>
<h2><a href="https://go.dev/doc/effective_go">Effective Go</a></h2>
<p>Still part of go.dev, but one of the first books you should read on how gophers
do things in the language.</p>
<h2><a href="https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/CodeReviewComments">Go Code Review Comments</a></h2>
<p>An intro to writing idiomatic Go, as well as some of the more idiomatic
patterns in the language, like defining interfaces near consumers, etc.</p>
<h1>Blogs to Follow</h1>
<p>Some regularly updated blogs to check for Go news or things happening in the
community.</p>
<h2><a href="https://go.dev/blog/">Go Blog</a></h2>
<p>Articles from the language maintainers themselves.
There's a lot here, I'll try to pick out particular articles as they pertain to
other categories.</p>
<h2><a href="https://dave.cheney.net/">Dave Cheney</a></h2>
<p>Can't say enough that this writer and speaker has done for the community.
He has articles and talks ranging from philosophical to deeply technical (yet
approachable) deep dives on the language.</p>
<h2><a href="https://www.gobeyond.dev/">Go Beyond</a></h2>
<p>Blog by Ben Johnson, creator of <a href="https://github.com/boltdb/bolt">BoltDB</a> and <a href="https://litestream.io/">Litestream</a>.</p>
<h2><a href="https://bitfieldconsulting.com/golang">Bitfield Consulting (John Arundel and others)</a></h2>
<p>I regularly recommend these articles and tutorials for any new thing in the
language.</p>
<h2><a href="https://bignerdranch.com/resources/blog/">Big Nerd Ranch</a></h2>
<p>My former Nerds(TM) add to this all the time, and I expect there will be more
and more Go posts (to add to mine).</p>
<h1>Tutorials</h1>
<h2><a href="https://gobyexample.com/">Go By Example</a></h2>
<p>A litany of concise examples using different bits and pieces of the language and
standard library.</p>
<h2><a href="https://blog.logrocket.com/creating-a-web-server-with-golang/">Logrocket web server</a></h2>
<p>Log Rocket's walkthrough for playing with a web server.</p>
<h2><a href="https://go.dev/blog/error-handling-and-go">Official Tutorial for Error Handling</a></h2>
<p>Pretty much required reading for errors in Go. Also check out the <a href="https://go.dev/blog/go1.13-errors">next iteration</a>
of this when the language hit 1.13 and added some more functionality for errors.</p>
<h1>Keeping it simple</h1>
<p>Talks and articles about one of the core tenets of Go: Simplicity.</p>
<h2><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFejpH_tAHM">Simplicity is Complicated</a></h2>
<p>If you ever wanted to know why Go has made core decisions about itself, Rob Pike
gives some answers.</p>
<h2><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqubKSF3wig">SQLite and Go</a></h2>
<p>David Crawshaw shows us all how to keep it simple with boring technology: a love
of SQLite and Go.</p>
<h1>Architecture</h1>
<h2><a href="https://github.com/katzien/go-structure-examples">Go Structure Examples</a></h2>
<p>Kat Zien tours different ways to not only structure Go applications, but ways to
think about structuring components in general.</p>
<h2><a href="https://pace.dev/blog/2018/05/09/how-I-write-http-services-after-eight-years.html">How I write HTTP services after eight years</a></h2>
<p>A great post from Mat Ryer on how to evolve an application from simple to
complex without immediately jumping to layers of indirection like unecessary
interfaces.</p>
