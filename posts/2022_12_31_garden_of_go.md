This is my curated list of Go links to talks, tutorials, articles, and other
things that have impacted my learning of this wonderful language.
While this is a post, expect it to be maintained regularly.
If you want to suggest a link, please [open an issue](https://github.com/jdholdren/blog/issues/new).

# Getting started

New to Go? Start here.

## [go.dev](https://go.dev)

This is the official site for Go and the Go blog.
You can download Go here, as well as take a [tour](https://go.dev/tour/welcome/1) of the language.

## [Effective Go](https://go.dev/doc/effective_go)

Still part of go.dev, but one of the first books you should read on how gophers
do things in the language.

## [Go Code Review Comments](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/CodeReviewComments)

An intro to writing idiomatic Go, as well as some of the more idiomatic
patterns in the language, like defining interfaces near consumers, etc.

# Blogs to Follow

Some regularly updated blogs to check for Go news or things happening in the
community.

## [Go Blog](https://go.dev/blog/)

Articles from the language maintainers themselves.
There\'s a lot here, I\'ll try to pick out particular articles as they pertain to
other categories.

## [Dave Cheney](https://dave.cheney.net/)

Can\'t say enough that this writer and speaker has done for the community.
He has articles and talks ranging from philosophical to deeply technical (yet
approachable) deep dives on the language.

## [Go Beyond](https://www.gobeyond.dev/)

Blog by Ben Johnson, creator of [BoltDB](https://github.com/boltdb/bolt) and [Litestream](https://litestream.io/).

## [Bitfield Consulting (John Arundel and others)](https://bitfieldconsulting.com/golang)

I regularly recommend these articles and tutorials for any new thing in the
language.

## [Big Nerd Ranch](https://bignerdranch.com/resources/blog/)

My former Nerds(TM) add to this all the time, and I expect there will be more
and more Go posts (to add to mine).

# Tutorials

## [Go By Example](https://gobyexample.com/)

A litany of concise examples using different bits and pieces of the language and
standard library.

## [Logrocket web server](https://blog.logrocket.com/creating-a-web-server-with-golang/)

Log Rocket\'s walkthrough for playing with a web server.

## [Official Tutorial for Error Handling](https://go.dev/blog/error-handling-and-go)

Pretty much required reading for errors in Go. Also check out the [next iteration](https://go.dev/blog/go1.13-errors)
of this when the language hit 1.13 and added some more functionality for errors.

# Keeping it simple

Talks and articles about one of the core tenets of Go: Simplicity.

## [Simplicity is Complicated](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFejpH_tAHM)

If you ever wanted to know why Go has made core decisions about itself, Rob Pike
gives some answers.

## [SQLite and Go](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqubKSF3wig)

David Crawshaw shows us all how to keep it simple with boring technology: a love
of SQLite and Go.

# Architecture

## [Go Structure Examples](https://github.com/katzien/go-structure-examples)

Kat Zien tours different ways to not only structure Go applications, but ways to
think about structuring components in general.

## [How I write HTTP services after eight years](https://pace.dev/blog/2018/05/09/how-I-write-http-services-after-eight-years.html)

A great post from Mat Ryer on how to evolve an application from simple to
complex without immediately jumping to layers of indirection like unecessary
interfaces.
